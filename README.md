# DASH_figures
## This project aims for analyzing the impact of ribodepleting ribosomal sequences from planarian scRNA-seq datasets.

We generated 3 biological replicates of X1 cells from planarians and split the libraries into untreated and DASH-treated. We performed side-by-side analysis to identify the impact of DASH in single-cell resolution.
